**Objective:** Build an Industrial IoT Freezer Monitor compliant with FDA Safety Standards.

---

## 1. The Engineering Scenario

You have been hired by a pharmaceutical logistics company. They transport sensitive vaccines that must stay frozen between **-30°C and -10°C**.

:::tip 📚 Theory Check
Do you understand **FDA 21 CFR Part 11** regulations?
[**Read the Safety Standards Article**](https://your-bookstack-url.com/books/safety-standards) on BookStack before continuing.
:::

**Your Mission:**

1.  Connect a BME280 sensor to the Slate v2.1 Node.
2.  Program the node to publish via MQTT.
3.  Visualize the "Safe Zones" on Grafana.

---

## 2. Hardware Setup (I2C)

We use the I2C protocol because it is digital and precise.

- **SDA (Data):** GPIO 21
- **SCL (Clock):** GPIO 22

:::info 📚 Theory Check
How does I2C addressing work? Why do we need pull-up resistors?

## 3. The Code Logic

Your firmware needs to read the sensor every 5 seconds.

```cpp
// Hint: Use the Adafruit_BME280 library
if (now - lastMsg > 5000) {
    float temp = bme.readTemperature();
    // TODO: Publish this to MQTT...
}
```

:::warning 🎓 Student Exercise
The code above is incomplete. You must implement the MQTT publish function.
**Instructors:** The full solution code is available in the [**Educator Portal**](https://your-bookstack-url.com/books/instructor-resources).
